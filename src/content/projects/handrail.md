Between the engineering and consulting projects, we like to keep the shop busy with custom fabrication work.   This important work helps to support our R&D projects, keeps us involved in other local and community business operations, and helps us develop and maintain our skills in fabrication.   We use these opportunities to learn best practices for supporting one of our key business offerings: Rapid Prototype Fabrication…after all, practice makes perfect!   Today’s project consisted of some custom fabricated hand-rail that will eventually get galvanized and spend the rest of its life outdoors at your local grocery store!
