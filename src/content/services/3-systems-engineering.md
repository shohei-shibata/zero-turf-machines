JKV has offered full systems engineering under one roof since it was started. This means physical equipment with sensors, and feedback motion control. We gained this expertise developing control systems for vehicle applications including, powertrain control, engine control, thermal management system control, HVAC, and more. We save our customers time and money by helping to design the physical system and then the electrical design, sensor package, control loops, and HMIs. We can develop control systems on embedded microprocessors or PLCs.
