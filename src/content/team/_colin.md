Early in Colinâ€™s career he worked as a project engineer on large civil construction projects and later transitioned to work with Ford Motor Company where he worked for nine years as a manufacturing engineer focusing on machining and assembly processes.  

His experience on both spectrums of scale from miles to microns allows him to not only see the larger picture, but how important it is to maintain detail awareness.  With extensive experience in troubleshooting and root cause analysis, feasibility and reliability are usually his number one concern.  Some of his most notable successes stem from a curiosity in mechanical processes and how quality is the only way to achieve and maintain desired results.
