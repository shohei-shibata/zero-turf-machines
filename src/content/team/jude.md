Jude Hueber graduated from Colorado State University in 2006 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering.  In college he became interested in robotics, and his first job was designing remotely operated equipment for Nuclear D&D projects.  A lifelong automotive enthusiast, Jude jumped at an opportunity to lead the engineering team for a start-up company that was developing new drive-train technology for heavy trucks.  This started his career in automotive and ultimately led to the founding of JKV as an engineering consulting company for special automotive projects.  In his free time, Jude enjoys building things for his wife's garden, being outside with his kids, and maintaining a 74 acre farm in Batavia, OH.  He is a mediocre musician, rock climber, and motorcycle rider when time affords.
