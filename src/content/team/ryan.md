After 12 years with Honda R&D, Ryan joined JKV as a Senior Project Engineer.   Ryan's 12 years at Honda provided him with a vast experience in the discipline of product development and "design for manufacturing" for primarily stamped steel and injection-molded Automotive plastic parts.   However, since then, Ryan has made large engineering contributions during his time at JKV to entire Prototype Vehicle Chassis/Suspension/Steering/Braking systems design, amongst other stationary and fully automated structures and machines.
